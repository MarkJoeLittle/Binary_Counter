# Binary_Counter
Design a nine step counter to count in the following sequence using J K flip flops (TTL 7476):
0011, 0101, 1001, 1000, 1011, 1010, 0110, 0100, 0111, 0011, â€¦.
Include in the design a means for resetting the counter to 0011.
You must submit a working Verilog simulation program file with your report. Please submit a .v file and a single compliant PDF document for your report.
Note:
I. You can use http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_7400_series_integrated_circuits
to find TTL chip you need. And http://ee.hawaii.edu/~sasaki/EE260/Labs/Datasheets/datasheets.html supplies you datasheets of some commonly used TTL chips.
